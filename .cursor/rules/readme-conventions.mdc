# Readme conventions (required)

## WHY
We keep relearning the same “how do I run this?” steps. Standardized readmes reduce churn and prevent drift.

## Rules
- Root-level docs must include a **“How to run (quick)”** section near the top.
- Prefer **named readmes** over generic `README.md`:
  - `frank.<Concept>.readme.md`
  - Example: `frank.linguaFranca.readme.md`
- Readmes should link to nested readmes (also named with the same convention) for module-specific details.
