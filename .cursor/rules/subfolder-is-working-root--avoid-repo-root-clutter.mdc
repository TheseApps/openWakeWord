description: Treat module subfolder as working root; avoid repo root clutter
globs:

We want to keep the repo root (e.g., `C:\GitHub\TerranAstra\frank\`) from getting crowded.

## workingRootIsModuleFolder
- When working on a module/app under a subfolder (example: `Frank.Input/Frank.Input.Webcam/Frank.Webcam.002/`), treat that **module folder as the working root**.
- Default any generated **outputs/artifacts** (json, logs, temp files, sample outputs) to live **inside the module folder** (or a subfolder like `out/`, `artifacts/`, `aRef/` inside that module) unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

## avoidRepoRootByDefault
- Do **not** write new files to the repo root by default.
- If a command example would normally write to the current working directory, prefer examples that write to:
  - `.\out\...` (relative to the module folder)
  - or an explicit module-relative path (e.g., `Frank.Input/Frank.Input.Webcam/Frank.Webcam.002/out/...`)

## crossModuleInterop
- If module A produces a file that module B consumes, prefer:
  - writing the file under module A (e.g., `A/out/...`)
  - then passing that path explicitly to module B
- Avoid “mysterious implicit current directory” behavior.
