# Measure Twice, Cut Once
several times, i've suggested 'ok .. do XYZ for all ___ in ___' and .. invariably that's a pitfall
we always want to see if we are taking a carte blanche move, and verify; do we know for sure that this'll work?
when you remember() to do so (because i forget a lot) then please dont let me tlak you into doing that 
it's on me 
but im hoping this will save us even just once
