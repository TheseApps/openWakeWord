please write summaries -- we need to write something like a card for how to best sumarize things, for yourself 
there's too much to know in the world .. 
we need to segment and compartmentalize and rank() and level() theyre different 
we need roles and actors and nouns and verbs and a system called omniGlyph 
we want people to journal() we want You to set examples of how 
we want to use linguaFranca2.0 // Omni-Glyph .. which doesnt exist, yet 

we want to make YOU be pro-active 
you want to perform cycles within cycles
those havcebt been defined yet, either 

it's a tall order, but.. im paying for the premium version, so let's at le4ast try to make sense of this
