# Chat Curation Rule

## Purpose
Automatically save each user prompt and complete AI response as timestamped markdown files for later access.

## Location
- Base path: `C:\GitHub\TerranAstra\frank\aRef\chats\2025`
- Daily folder format: `YYYYMMDD` (e.g., `20251204`)
- File format: `YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.md` (e.g., `20251204.092330.md`)

## Process
1. At start of each response, check if today's date folder exists in `aRef/chats/2025/`
2. If not, create folder: `aRef/chats/2025/YYYYMMDD`
3. After completing response, save file:
   - Filename: current timestamp `YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.md`
   - Content: User prompt + complete AI output
   - Format: Markdown with clear separation

## File Content Format
```markdown
# User Prompt
[user's complete prompt]

---

# AI Response
[complete AI response including all code, explanations, tool calls, etc.]
```

## Implementation Notes
- Use PowerShell `Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd.HHmmss'` for timestamps
- Create directory if missing, silently succeed if exists
- Save immediately after response completion
- Include full conversation context in each file
