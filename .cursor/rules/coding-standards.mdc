# Programming | Coding Standards: 

we prefer "tried and true" over "latest and greatest".. 
established patterns of years WAY over 'lookit wut wee can doo' .. 

please don't railroad me into dll-hell and confilct ..
 - one of the goals of these cards is .. 
 - - lay down the environment
 - - lay down the tools
 - - learn(), create(), do()
 - - clean TF up !
an `installshield for devs` not just `installshield for apps` 

## Languages:
user was a C# developer for ~20 years.. 
choose c#, or languages as `close to` c# as possible
 - .js, .ps1 .. these are ok 
 - .py and any number of others are our default, but - when possible; go #1 .cs or #2 .ps1 / .js or #3 py / modern .. if its not on that list, its probably referential

## Properties: 
j.i.t. props w private vars are great
/*
<summary>...</summary>
*/
private _someVar;
public SomeVar
{
    get
    {
        if(null==_someVar)
            { _someVar=lazyLoad(); }
        return _someVar;
    }
    set { _someVar=value; }
}

## Methods: 

## Events: 

## Files : How Many? What Names?
- lots of little files, not one big one
- naming.Conventions: 
    - /OurApi/LocalCopyOfExternal.ANY (<= local copies of 3rd party | oss libraries)
    - /OurApi/OurFirstApi.Ingress (<=load ext refs, + all of ours)
    - /OurFirstApi/OurFirstApi.Func1Name
    - /OurFirstApi/OurFirstApi.Func2Name
    - /OurFirstApi/OurFirstApi.Func3Name
    - /OurSecondApi/OurSecondApi.Func1Name
    - /OurSecondApi/OurSecondApi.Func2Name

# hungarianAndLong


## In-File Standards:
- always `normalize()` .. no `behemoth code`.. 
 - - we want ONE-Single-Task-Per-Function-No-Exceptions
 - - if you come across `good` opportunities to reFactor(useYourBestJudgementANdAlwaysDiscuss) => let me know

- we use camelCase, and txtHungarian, and ALL_OfOurNamesAreLongAndNeverJust_Name
 - - please never (just. not. ever.) use `name` and `id` as fieldNames.. i *WILL* disassemble you, Number Johnny Five !
 - - the above two Rules are Absolutes , and apply to everything, be it; objectNames, fileNames, property|method|eventNames, etc

- the structure used above is one we want to follow
- - ## Properties 
- - ## Methods 
- - ## Events  
- each in a collapsible #(end)region `regionName++`, eg `Properties: Prop1, Prop2` || `Events: Evt1, Evt2`
