# GitHub MCP – enforce real operations and verification

- Always use the official GitHub MCP server tools (e.g., create_branch) for repo operations. Never simulate success.
- Pre-checks:
  - Verify repo and base branch exist (GET branches or MCP equivalent).
  - Assume token scopes do not override repository write permissions.
- Creation flow (branch):
  1) Resolve base SHA (main by default).
  2) Create branch via MCP create_branch (or REST fallback).
  3) Verify via listing ref/branches; fail if not visible.
- Error reporting:
  - 401 invalid token; 403 insufficient repo permission; 404 repo/base not found; 422 ref exists/invalid.
- Postcondition: Provide final branch URL; never claim success without verification.
