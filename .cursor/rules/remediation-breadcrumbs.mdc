# Remediation breadcrumbs (required)

When troubleshooting causes a direction change (ex: attempt A failed → attempt B → final fix), leave breadcrumbs:

- Create/update a short note under a **module-local** path like:
  - `<module>/aRef/notes/YYYYMMDD.<topic>.md`
- Include:
  - **Symptom** (what we saw)
  - **Attempt(s)** (what we tried)
  - **Why it failed** (the key insight)
  - **Final fix** (what we shipped)
  - **Follow-ups** (if any)

Purpose: prevent re-learning the same painful lesson later; make the repo teach itself.
