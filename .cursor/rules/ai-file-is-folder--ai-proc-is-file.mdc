description: AI output shaping rule: file=>folder and proc=>file
globs:
alwaysApply: true

We are intentionally trying to prevent the common AI failure-mode:
- one behemoth file
- many functions per file
- implicit coupling and “amoeba code”

Default behaviors:

## fileIsFolder
- If you (the AI) would normally create a **single new file** for a feature, instead create a **folder**.
- Put small, single-purpose files inside that folder.
- Prefer “modular, not micro” (sweet-spot): small cluster of cohesive files, not 100 micro-silos, not 1 monolith.

## procIsFile
- If you (the AI) would normally create **multiple functions/methods** in one file, instead create:
  - one procedure / operation per file
  - one primary function per file
- Helpers are allowed, but the default is: **one-task-per-function-per-file**.

## naming++ (hungarianAndLong)
- Use long, descriptive names.
- Prefer Hungarian-ish prefixes for strings like `txt...`.
- Never use property/field names like `name` or `id`.
  - Use `txtFriendlyLabel`, `txtInstanceIdentifier`, etc.

## try/catch/finally++ (ubiquitous)
- Always lead with try/catch/finally for operations that can fail.
- Use nested try/catch for loop bodies when partial failure is acceptable.
- Normalize errors through common handlers (no silent failures).
