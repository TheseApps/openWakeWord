description: Command examples should be copy/paste-able from repo root by default

We want commands that are easy to run even when the user is “in the dumb”:
- The terminal often opens at repo root (e.g., `C:\GitHub\TerranAstra\frank\`).
- Users may forget to `cd` into a module folder.

## defaultCommandCwdIsRepoRoot
- When giving command examples, **assume the current working directory is the repo root**.
- Prefer commands that can be copied from the AI and pasted directly into the default terminal.

## modulePathsShouldBeExplicit
- Use explicit module-relative paths from repo root, e.g.:
  - `.\Frank.Input\Frank.Input.Webcam\Frank.Input.Webcam.005\...`
- Avoid relying on implicit `cd` state unless explicitly requested.

## stillRespectWorkingRootIsModuleFolder
- For generated artifacts (outputs, logs, json), still write into the **module’s** `.\out\` directory.
- Example: `...\Frank.Input.Webcam.005\out\...` (not repo root `.\out\...`).
