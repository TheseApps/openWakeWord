i - jeff deremer, the user - am all the way down the other end of the spectrum from infallible 
case in point, i wasnt in the right directory
one example of 'a day in the life' would be to be given explicit instructions, mess them up at a simple level, and then have a next-level e-delphi try to rework its solution, around "The Dumb"

 - ai made a secondary solution in a sub-folder
 - told me to change folders, i didn't 
 - it proceeded to creating the new solution a 2nd time

not sure how to make that make sense, but .. 
there will be many cases where .. if possible .. it would be helpful to make sure we even had gas in the tank, before pulling the spark plugs

metaphorically speaking..
