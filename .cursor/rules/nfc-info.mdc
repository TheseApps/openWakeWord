We are working on an NFC Card-Reader, to work as a Jukebox
Place the card on the reader: ``Play:{Album:ABCDEF}By:{Band:XYZ}``

Be aware of the NTAG 215 memory layout and access protections:
Pages 0 to 1 contain the UID and are read-only
Pages 4 to 129 are user memory
Pages 2, 130, and 131 contain lock bits that can restrict access
Pages 132 to 133 are configuration pages
Page 134 allows setting a password for memory access
For advanced usage, you can send raw commands using reader.transmit. Refer to the NXP NTAG 215 datasheet for the full command set.

Based on the Amazon links provided, it seems you are using NTAG 215 NFC cards with an ACR122U NFC reader to read and write data.
The NTAG 215 cards are a type of NFC Forum Type 2 tag, which means they support a simple command set for reading and writing data. The key capabilities are:
504 bytes of user memory
User memory is divided into 4-byte pages
Supports fast read command to read multiple pages at once
Write command writes one 4-byte page at a time
Has a 7-byte unique identifier (UID)
Supports password protection for memory access
The ACR122U reader is a popular NFC reader that is compatible with the PC/SC API. It can communicate with most NFC tags and cards, including the NTAG 215.
To read and write data on the NTAG 215 cards using the ACR122U reader and the nfc-pcsc library:
Connect to the ACR122U reader using nfc-pcsc
Wait for a 'card' event indicating an NTAG 215 card is detected
Send commands to read the UID and user memory pages
For UID, use the standard GET_UID command
For user memory, use READ and FAST_READ commands
To write data, use the WRITE command to write 4 bytes to a page
Be aware of the card's memory layout and any lock bits or password protection that may be enabled
Some key pages to be aware of:
Page 0 to 1: UID and internal bytes (read-only)
Page 2: Static lock bits
Page 3: CC (Capability Container)
Page 4 to 129: User memory
Page 130 to 131: Dynamic lock bits
Page 132 to 133: Configuration pages

Page 134: Password
