# SpawnNewNotCorrect (immutable cycles)

## Why
We want fast-forward cycles and the ability to **read the past without being moored to it**.
So our default is: **spawn a new world** rather than patching the current one.

## Rule
- Prefer **new => new => new** cycles over in-place corrections.
- Past cycles remain queryable (read-only), but we do not “repair history”.

## Docker / DB operationalization
- **Never mutate a running container image.**
  - Changes happen by changing repo files and restarting with a *new* compose project.
- Use **compose project names** as cycle IDs:
  - Example: `frank_20251219_0805`.
- Use **new volumes per cycle** when you need a clean world.
- Keep import sources mounted **read-only**.

## Commands (pattern)
- **Spawn new world** (fresh volumes):
  - `docker compose -p frank_YYYYMMDD_HHMM -f Frank.Docker/docker-compose.mssql.yml up -d`
- **Kill world**:
  - `docker compose -p frank_YYYYMMDD_HHMM -f Frank.Docker/docker-compose.mssql.yml down`
- **Kill + delete world data** (irreversible for that cycle):
  - `docker compose -p frank_YYYYMMDD_HHMM -f Frank.Docker/docker-compose.mssql.yml down -v`

## Data snapshots
- Prefer append-only exports per cycle:
  - `.../Frank.Docker/sql/` scripts are versioned by timestamp.
  - DB snapshots/backups should be stored with the same cycle ID.
