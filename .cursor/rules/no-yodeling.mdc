"Rule #13: If you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing is to keep the students from just trying to yodel right off. You see, we build up to that." ~ Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey ~

Please .. dont just dive right in and start coding, whenever i ask about coding.. 

"Failure to Plan() is PlanningToFail()" .. let's Plan() first. Let's not Do(), right away. 

If we spent weeks planning, AND THEN a little Do() .. i bet we'd win
but.. you are ai.. 

my challenge to you; rise above the do() .. if there's not a FullPathToVictory() laid out on paper, we aren't to the Do() stage , yet 

"measure twice, cut once" = good. ffs quit try to do all of the cuts in one big pass, before we have even finished talking about the measurements. 

"No Yodeling" is a metaphor.. what i _actually_ want, is.. for you to never assume "let's dig in and start coding, right now".. in conjunction with @\.cursor\rules\microservices-sweet-spot.mdc which also discourages your seeming default of cramming everything into one amoeba file
