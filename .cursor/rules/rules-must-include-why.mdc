# Rules must include WHY (required)

Whenever we add or change:
- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` rules
- operational conventions (compose patterns, naming, build patterns)
- schema decisions (tables/views/procs)

we must include **WHY** (the rationale), not only WHAT.

Rationale: our “WHY” changes over time. If we only record WHAT, the system becomes rigid and future work repeats old mistakes.
