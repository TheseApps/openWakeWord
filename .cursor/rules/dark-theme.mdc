we want to default to dark theme for everything 
any ui we make should give the option of both*
preferably -- a handful of common themes , but .. 

if the world would default to dark theme, i think that that change alone would save ?? millions in volts n watts n shit , and regardless; OUR default is dark theme 

please remember to offset the text to a cream or something that isn't gray-on-black and impossible to read, but not harshly white, either .. not sure what tone? maybe a light gray? not that charcoal thats been used in a few app outputs
