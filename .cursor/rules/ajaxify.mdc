we want to ajaxify everything
load the page
load all elements
laodContentThroughAjax()
if there is an element on-screen, that interactsa in any way w the server - it does so w ajax.. the updates are reflected via ajax
we approach this entirely from the midnset of 'we want a system whose lag-time is limited exclusively to content.content.update() -- nothing more'
